This animation demonstrates a real-life application of Ordinary Differential Equations. We have a graph with time on the x-axis and the quantity of radioactive elements on the y-axis. The differential equation 
𝑑𝑁 = -𝜆N  shows that the rate of change of the quantity N  is proportional to 𝑁 with λ as the decay constant.
𝑑𝑡

In our animation, the blue circle represents the nucleus, with yellow electrons orbiting around it. As time progresses, some electrons 'decay,' simulating the loss of radioactive elements, which is shown by the electrons gradually disappearing. The dashed line on the graph tracks this change.

This visualization helps us understand exponential decay and how it can be modeled mathematically, bringing theory to life."
